# Singapore Real Estate Analytics Project

In this Python project, I did the below: 
 1. Retrieved and combined datasets of public housing resale data in Singapore
 2. Cleaned the data from part 1
 3. Perform exploratory data analysis based on the clean dataset
 4. Dummify features in preparation of machine learning
 5. Apply machine learning techniques to train a model to predict housing resale prices
 
 From #1 to #3, I also:
  1. Came up with a PowerBI report with several interactive dashboards to allow investors to more easily visualize the dataset
  2. Summarized some findings in a form of a ppt deck to be used as an investor's report
